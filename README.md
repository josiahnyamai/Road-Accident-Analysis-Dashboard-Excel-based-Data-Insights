# Road Accident Analysis Dashboard – Excel-based Data Insights

This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard that analyzes road accident data to uncover insights into accident severity, casualty trends, vehicle types involved, and road conditions. The dashboard was designed for data-driven decision-making to help stakeholders understand the root causes and contributing factors to road accidents.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard is built using Microsoft Excel and incorporates charts, pivot tables, and slicers to present key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends.

### ✅ Primary KPIs:
- **Total Casualties**: Displays the total number of casualties resulting from road accidents.
- **Casualties by Accident Severity**: Shows the percentage distribution of casualties based on the severity of accidents (e.g., Fatal, Serious, Slight).
- **Maximum Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Identifies which vehicle type is most frequently involved in accidents with the highest casualty count.

### 🔄 Secondary KPIs:
- **Casualties by Vehicle Type**: Presents the distribution of total casualties across different types of vehicles.

### 📅 Time-Based Analysis:
- **Monthly Trend**: Compares the monthly trend of casualties for the current year versus the previous year to highlight seasonal or periodic changes.

### 🛣️ Road & Environmental Analysis:
- **Maximum Casualties by Road Type**: Identifies which road types (e.g., single carriageway, dual carriageway, roundabout) contribute to the highest number of casualties.
- **Casualties by Road Surface Conditions**: Visualizes the distribution of casualties based on surface conditions such as dry, wet, or icy roads.
- **Casualties by Area and Time**: Explores how casualties differ between urban/rural areas and day/night timeframes.

## 📂 Project Files

- `ReadMe.md` – Project documentation.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Slicers, Charts)
- Raw Dataset (source not specified)

## 📌 Key Insights
- Vehicle type and road condition play a crucial role in accident severity.
- Casualty trends exhibit seasonality, with some months more prone to accidents.
- Urban areas and nighttime contribute significantly to casualty numbers.

## 💡 Future Improvements
- Integrate with Power BI or Tableau for richer interactive capabilities.
- Use external data sources like weather and traffic for predictive analytics.
- Build a web-based version using Python (Pandas, Dash) for broader access.
